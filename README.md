# Banglore-House-Price-Prediction

We are going to Predict the Price Of Houses in Banglore depending upon the factors like location, Square Feet Area, Number of Bathrooms, BHK by using different models like Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor and see which one gives more accuracy.<br>
<br>Steps I used to solve the Problem are:
<li>Importing Libraries and dataset
<li>Data Cleaning
<li>Check the Missing Values
<li>Feature Engineering
<li>Outlier Removal using standard deviation and mean
<li>Outlier Removal Using Bathrooms Feature
<li>One Hot Encoding For Location
<li>Building Model
<li>Find best model using GridSearchCV
<li>Testing the model for few properties
